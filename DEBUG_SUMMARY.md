# Assignment Management Debug Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Assignment Details Modal Showing Wrong Data
**Problem**: Details modal always showed the same lecturer ("Dr. John Smith") and static data regardless of which assignment was selected.

**Root Cause**: Frontend was calling incorrect API endpoint `/api/assignment?taskId=...` instead of the correct `/hed/api/assignment?taskId=...`.

**Solution**: Updated frontend JavaScript to use correct endpoints:
- Assignment details: `/hed/api/assignment?taskId=...`
- Assignment questions: `/hed/api/assignment/questions?taskId=...`

**Files Modified**:
- `QuizClear/src/main/resources/Template/HEAD_OF_DEPARTMENT/HED_AssignmentManagement.html` (lines 267, 406)

### 2. Assignment Creation and Display
**Status**: âœ… **Already Working**
- Backend correctly receives lecturer ID and assignment data
- Assignment table displays correct lecturer names
- Form validation works properly

## Assignment Status Workflow

### Status Values and Meanings:
1. **IN_PROGRESS** - Assignment is currently being worked on by lecturer
2. **PENDING** - Assignment submitted by lecturer, waiting for review
3. **COMPLETED** - Assignment work finished but not yet approved
4. **APPROVED** - Assignment approved by Head of Department
5. **REJECTED** - Assignment rejected, needs revision

### Assignment Deletion Rules
**Current Implementation**: Assignments can be deleted regardless of status.

**Recommendation**: Consider implementing status-based deletion rules:
- Allow deletion for: `IN_PROGRESS`, `PENDING`
- Restrict deletion for: `APPROVED`, `COMPLETED` (to maintain records)
- Special handling for: `REJECTED` (may need revision instead of deletion)

**Backend Methods**:
- `HEDAssignmentController.deleteAssignment()` - DELETE `/hed/api/assignments/{taskId}`
- `TaskAssignmentService.deleteTaskAssignment()` - No status validation currently

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Assignment Creation
1. Go to Assignment Management page
2. Click "New Assign" button
3. Fill form with different lecturers and courses
4. Verify assignment appears in table with correct lecturer name

### 2. Test Assignment Details Modal
1. Click "Details" button on any assignment
2. Verify modal shows:
   - Correct assignment title
   - Correct lecturer name (should be different for different assignments)
   - Correct due date
   - Correct course information
   - Dynamic status (not always the same)

### 3. Test Assignment Questions
1. Open assignment details modal
2. Click "View Questions" tab
3. Verify questions are loaded for the specific assignment

### 4. Test Assignment Deletion
1. Click delete button on any assignment
2. Verify assignment is removed from the list
3. **Note**: Currently no status restrictions apply

## Debug Logging Added

### Frontend (HED_AssignmentManagement.html):
- Assignment creation form submission logging
- Assignment table rendering logging  
- Assignment details modal API response logging
- Lecturer name setting verification

### Backend (HEDAssignmentController.java):
- Assignment creation parameter logging
- Assignment listing with lecturer name verification
- Assignment details retrieval logging

## API Endpoints Reference

### Working Endpoints:
- `GET /hed/api/assignments` - List assignments (with pagination and filters)
- `POST /hed/api/assignments` - Create new assignment
- `DELETE /hed/api/assignments/{taskId}` - Delete assignment
- `GET /hed/api/assignment?taskId=...` - Get assignment details
- `GET /hed/api/assignment/questions?taskId=...` - Get assignment questions
- `GET /hed/api/lecturers` - Get lecturers for current department
- `GET /hed/api/courses` - Get courses for current department

### Department-Based Filtering:
All APIs automatically filter data based on the current user's department to ensure proper data isolation.

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Status-Based Deletion**: Implement business rules for when assignments can be deleted
2. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Add confirmation before deleting assignments
3. **Audit Trail**: Log assignment deletions for tracking
4. **Bulk Operations**: Allow selecting multiple assignments for bulk actions
5. **Status Transitions**: Implement proper status workflow validation
